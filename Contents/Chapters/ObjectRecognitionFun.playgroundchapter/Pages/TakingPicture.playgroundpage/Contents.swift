/*:
 Welcome back üòÅ! Hopefully, you learned a lot and enjoyed the awesomeness of recognizing handwritten digits from the last chapter!
 
 In this chapter, we are going to do something similar with [Core ML](glossary://coreml), but in my opinion way cooler!
 
 In this chapter we are going to (drumroll, wait for it!): Recognize objects in images! By the end of this chapter we'll be detecting what the object in an image such as an orange, watch, etc. Doesn't this sound super cool?!
 - - -
 Before we dive in, let's run through the process step by step in order to make sure you fully grasp what we are about to do.
 
 1. Find an object - it must be a soda bottle, bagel, hourglass, or television - and take a picture of it!
 2. Run our [Core ML](glossary://coreml) model on the object. This time; however, we won't be relying on [Vision](glossary://vision) to help us out. Instead, we will just be using [Core ML](glossary://coreml) and passing our images directly via the use of a [CVPixelBuffer](glossary://pixelbuffer). This will help demonstrate the options you have when recognizing images.

 - Important:
 Unfortunately, the size of this model had to be limited to adhere to the 25 MB size limit of the playground. As a result, this model is trained only on a limited amount of items. As a result, a soda bottle, bagel, hourglass, and television are a few of the items it will work on along with a couple other more exotic items you may not be able to take a picture of. If you have access to the items listed above, take a picture üì∏! If you don't, no worries! Sample images will be provided on the next screen which will work great with our model!
 - - -
 Alright, enough talk! Let's get started üéâ!
 
 **Your Task**: Take a quick stroll and find any object you like and take a picture of it!
 
 - Callout(Can't access the camera or prefer to use a sample image?):
 No worries, just *skip* this page and head over to the next page where sample images will be available!
