/*:
 Nice job getting the camera to work in the [previous page](@previous)! By now, you are probably a master of cameras haha ðŸ˜€! In this page, we are going to get into the really fun part: drawing in 3D!
 - - -
 Before we dive in, let's run through the drawing process step by step in order to make sure you fully grasp what we are about to do.
 
 1. Initialize an `ARSCNView` that will allow us to place 3D content in AR.
 2. Store the previously drawn point and use that to draw a point between the previous and the current point.
 3. Apply the line color that you chose to the line that will be drawn.
 4. Enjoy the wonderful creation you've drawn in [ARKit](glossary://arkit).
