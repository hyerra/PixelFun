/*:
 Hopefully, you had fun building the custom filter in the [previous page](@previous)! If you felt creative and modified the kernel, that's awesome! Hopefully, my code was able to provide a foundation for you to create amazing and interesting effects üòÄ.
 - - -
 The next day, however, you go back to work feeling proud of being able to create awesome filters. You are going to be looking like a star in all your photos now! However, your boss heard about your talent from one of your co-workers. He stops you just as you leave work and asks you if you'd be willing to create some effects for some photos he has on his computer. Being a kind person, you agree and decide that maybe the filter we built on the [previous page](@next) looks really nice but you want to add a little bit more! You decide that you want to create a neat little blur around the face to add a nice effect ‚ú®.
 - - -
 In this page, we are going to take what we learned up a notch by chaining multiple filters in a way that ensures optimum performance. Additionally, we are going to be using the power of [Core Image](glossary://coreimage) to detect where a face is located to include an interesting blur. It'll look really cool and I hope you'll enjoy it!
 
 Let's get to work üéä!
